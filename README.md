# Sublight_Engines_Landing_Page

The website is pretty straightforward, so there's not much to discuss here, but for the sake of it, I'll share my 5 thoughts on the whole process.

1. I liked it, I think Front-End was a good choice.
2. You can get easily lost in the divs if you are not well structured. It'll take time and practice.
3. CSS is all about FlexBloxes and Postitioning, the rest is nice fluff. I have to see the boxes
    (Inspecting it helps, but having it in your head prior saves time and give you a better understanding
     of your structure.)
4. I think Frameworks should accelerate the process, going raw like this is too long.
5. Sevada & Patrick take too much risks in their shots at Ping-Pong. They are easy to win against if you bid your time.

    That's all of my observations for Week 9.
