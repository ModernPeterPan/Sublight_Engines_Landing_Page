# Sublight_Engines_Landing_Page

The website is pretty straightforward, so there's not much to discuss here, but for the sake of it, I'll share my 5 thoughts on the whole process.

1. I liked it, I think Front-End was a good choice.
2. You can get easily lost in the divs if you are not well structured. It'll take time and practice.
3. CSS is all about FlexBloxes and Postitioning, the rest is nice fluff. I have to see the boxes
    (Inspecting it helps, but having it in your head prior saves time and give you a better understanding
     of your structure.)
4. I think Frameworks should accelerate the process, going raw like this is too long.
5. Sevada & Patrick take too much risks in their shots at Ping-Pong. They are easy to win against if you bid your time.

    That's all of my observations for Week 9.

    
    
    --- UPDATES OF WEEK 10 ---
I've now made the whole page responsive and switch to a mobile version under 930px of width. On that version, I have a CTA at the bottom and the menu fitting in an hamburger menu at the top. If you click on the hamburger, you get the usual options. 

Also, I've made some validations work on the form page. If you don't put the right information you will get alerts when you don't fill correctly the input fields. If it works, you will get a green check on the line that worked. If all fields are okay, you will get another image saying that everything worked and you will get an email through email.js.

Unfortunately, because I'm broke, I went with the free version which has huge limitations. So to test that feature with your email, you will have to send me your email prior to the testing.

    MY OBSERVATIONS
Working with absolute positioning adds a lot of problem as thoses boxes doesn't "exist" in the actual structure and can create some problem with the size of the screen. It's something that creat some issue with the nav-bar dpending on the width and height. I'm curious how I'll adapt to that in the future, but besides that, I feel I improved a lot in only 2 weeks. Let's see what will bring the React framework next week.
